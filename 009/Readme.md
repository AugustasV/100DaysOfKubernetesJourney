# Autoscale and ConfigMap, secret

## Introduction

Went through Kubernetes concepts and operations, including scaling deployments, autoscaling based on CPU usage, working with ConfigMaps, creating secrets, and managing volumes and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).

## Prerequisite

- A working Kubernetes cluster.
- `kubectl` command-line tool configured to communicate with cluster.

## Use Case

Understanding and mastering these Kubernetes concepts and operations is vital for successfully configuring and managing applications within a Kubernetes environment.

## Research

- [Using Local Path Provisioner](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/local_path_provisioner/): Learn how to set up local path provisioning for storage in Kubernetes.
- [Configure a Pod to Use a PersistentVolume for Storage](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-persistent-volume-storage/): Dive into configuring pods to use PersistentVolumes for storage needs.

## Try It Yourself


By actively practicing, you'll gain hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of these essential Kubernetes concepts.

1. **Scaling Deployments:** Use the `kubectl scale` command to scale a deployment, adjusting the number of pod replicas as needed.

2. **Autoscaling Based on CPU Usage:** Implement autoscaling for a deployment, ensuring it dynamically adjusts the number of replicas based on CPU utilization.

3. **Working with ConfigMaps:** Create a ConfigMap, add it to your deployment, and observe how environment variables from the ConfigMap become available within the pod.

4. **Creating Secrets:** Create a secret, retrieve its values, and decode them as necessary to securely manage sensitive information within your Kubernetes applications.

5. **Managing Volumes and PVCs:** Create PersistentVolumes and matching PersistentVolumeClaims, and configure them in your application pods to efficiently manage storage.
