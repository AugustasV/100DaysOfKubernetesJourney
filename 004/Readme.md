# Still DevSpace

## Introduction

Tried to use DevSpace on kubernetes kluster


## Try yourself

YAML editing and debugging takes time, errors sometimes not so easy to understand. DevSpace documentation written pretty clear, also on Kubernetes slack channel Lukas Gentele helped to clarify some questions and debug some errors that I received

I was trying things out couple of days like that. At the end with command `devspace dev` could deploy program into local cluster. Than tried to deploy into production, what means deploying to prod, some errors appeared.
